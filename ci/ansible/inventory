# CI host definition
#

# This inventory will have one host identified as the ci host. By default, this function will
# be assumed by the first hypervisor host, which is the same behavior as the first commented
# out line. The second commented out line would set the second hypervisor to be the ci host.
# The final commented out line would set the ci host to be a different host that is not being
# used as a hypervisor in this inventory.
