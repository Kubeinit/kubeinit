# Hosts definitions
#

# The cluster's guest machines can be distributed across mutiple hosts. By default they
# will be deployed in the first Hypervisor. These hypervisors are activated and used
# depending on how they are referenced in the kubeinit spec string.
#
# When we are running the setup-playbook, if a hypervisor host has an ssh_hostname attribute
# then a .ssh/config file will be created and an entry mapping the ansible_host to that
# ssh hostname will be created. In the first commented out example we would associate
# the ansible_host of the first hypervisor host "nyctea" with the hostname provided, it
# can be a short or fully qualified name, but it needs to be resolvable on the host we
# are running the kubeinit setup from. The second example uses a host ip address, which
# can be useful in those cases where the host you are using doesn't have a dns name.

[hypervisor_hosts]
hypervisor-01 ansible_host=nyctea
hypervisor-02 ansible_host=tyto
# hypervisor-01 ansible_host=nyctea ssh_hostname=server1.example.com
# hypervisor-02 ansible_host=tyto ssh_hostname=192.168.222.202

# The inventory will have one host identified as the bastion host. By default, this role will
# be assumed by the first hypervisor, which is the same behavior as the first commented out
# line. The second commented out line would set the second hypervisor to be the bastion host.
# The final commented out line would set the bastion host to be a different host that is not
# being used as a hypervisor for the guests VMs for the clusters using this inventory.

[bastion_host]
# bastion target=hypervisor-01
# bastion target=hypervisor-02
# bastion ansible_host=bastion

# The inventory will have one host identified as the ovn-central host. By default, this role
# will be assumed by the first hypervisor, which is the same behavior as the first commented
# out line. The second commented out line would set the second hypervisor to be the ovn-central
# host.

[ovn_central_host]
# ovn-central target=hypervisor-01
# ovn-central target=hypervisor-02

#
# Setup host definition (used only with the setup-playbook.yml)
#

# This inventory will have one host identified as the setup host. By default, this will be
# localhost, which is the same behavior as the first commented out line. The second commented
# out line would set the first hypervisor host to be the setup host. The final commented out
# line would set the setup host to be a different host that is not being used as a hypervisor
# in this inventory.

[setup_host]
# kubeinit-setup ansible_host=localhost
# kubeinit-setup ansible_host=nyctea
# kubeinit-setup ansible_host=192.168.222.214
