###
# The cluster's guest VM nodes can be distributed across mutiple hosts. By default they
# will be deployed in the first Hypervisor. These hypervisors are activated and used
# depending on how they are referenced in the kubeinit spec string.
#
# In the first example we would associate the ansible_host of the first hypervisor host
# "nyctea" with the hostname provided, it can be a short or fully qualified name, but it
# needs to be resolvable on the host we are running kubeinit from. The second example
# uses a host ip address, which can be useful in those cases where the host you are using
# doesn't have a dns name.
#
# Examples:
#
# -e hypervisor_hosts_spec='[{"host":"hypervisor-01","ansible_host":"nyctea","ssh_hostname":"server1.example.com"}]'

# -e hypervisor_hosts_spec='[{"host":"hypervisor-01","ansible_host":"192.168.222.202"}]'
#

###
# The inventory will have one host identified as the bastion host. By default, this role will
# be assumed by the first hypervisor. The first example would set the second hypervisor to be
# the bastion host. The final example would set the bastion host to be a different host that
# is not being used as a hypervisor for the guests VMs of the cluster.
#
# Examples:
#
# -e bastion_host_spec='{"host":"bastion","target":"hypervisor-02"}'
#
# -e bastion_host_spec='{"host":"bastion","ansible_host":"bastion.example.com"}'
#

###
# The inventory will have one host identified as the ovn-central host. By default, this role
# will be assumed by the first hypervisor. The example would set the second hypervisor to be
# the ovn-central host.
#
# Example:
#
# -e ovn_central_host_spec='{"host":"ovn-central","target":"hypervisor-02"}'
