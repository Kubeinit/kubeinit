# Hosts definitions
#

###
# The cluster's guest machines can be distributed across mutiple hosts. By default they
# will be deployed in the first Hypervisor. These hypervisors are activated and used
# depending on how they are referenced in the kubeinit spec string.
#
# When we are running the setup-playbook, if a hypervisor host has an ssh_hostname attribute
# then a .ssh/config file will be created and an entry mapping the ansible_host to that
# ssh hostname will be created. In the first example we would associate
# the ansible_host of the first hypervisor host "nyctea" with the hostname provided, it
# can be a short or fully qualified name, but it needs to be resolvable on the host we
# are running the kubeinit setup from. The second example uses a host ip address, which
# can be useful in those cases where the host you are using doesn't have a dns name.
#
# .. code-block:: yaml
#
#    hypervisor_hosts:
#        hypervisor-01:
#            ansible_host: nyctea
#            ssh_hostname: server1.example.com
#        hypervisor-02:
#            ansible_host: tyto
#            ssh_hostname: 192.168.222.202
hypervisor_hosts:
  hypervisor-01:
    ansible_host: nyctea
  hypervisor-02:
    ansible_host: tyto

###
# The inventory will have one host identified as the bastion host. By default, this role will
# be assumed by the first hyperviso. The example would set the second hypervisor to be the bastion host.
# The final example would set the bastion host to be a different host that is not
# being used as a hypervisor for the guests VMs for the clusters using this inventory.
#
# .. code-block:: yaml
#
#    bastion_host:
#        bastion:
#            ansible_host: hypervisor-02
#
# .. code-block:: yaml
#
#    bastion_host:
#        bastion:
#            ansible_host: bastion
bastion_host:
  bastion:
    target: hypervisor-01

###
# The inventory will have one host identified as the ovn-central host. By default, this role
# will be assumed by the first hypervisor. The first example would set the second hypervisor
# to be the ovn-central host.
#
# .. code-block:: yaml
#
#    ovn_central_host:
#        target: hypervisor-02
ovn_central_host:
  ovn-central:
    target: hypervisor-01

###
#
# Setup host definition (used only with the setup-playbook.yml)
#
#
# This inventory will have one host identified as the setup host. By default, this will be
# localhost. The first example would set the first hypervisor host to be the setup host.
# The last example would set the setup host to be a different host that is not being used
# as a hypervisor in this inventory.
#
# .. code-block:: yaml
#
#    setup_host:
#        ansible_host: nyctea
#
# or
#
# .. code-block:: yaml
#
#    setup_host:
#        ansible_host: 192.168.222.214
setup_host:
