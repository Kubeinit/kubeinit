This is a community driven Open Source project,
as such it needs support to keep it alive and
evolving.

This project is supported by a set
of individual companies by providing
some specific resources.

      `Docker <https://www.docker.com/>`_ is a set of platform as a service
      (PaaS) products that use OS-level virtualization to deliver software
      in packages called containers. Containers are isolated from one another
      and bundle their own software, libraries and configuration files; they
      can communicate with each other through well-defined channels. Because
      all of the containers share the services of a single operating system
      kernel, they use fewer resources than virtual machines.

      `Docker Hub <https://hub.docker.com/>`_ is the world's largest repository
      of container images with an array of content sources including container
      community developers, open source projects and independent software vendors
      (ISV) building and distributing their code in containers. Users get access
      to free public repositories for storing and sharing images or can choose
      subscription plan for private repos.

      `Docker <https://www.docker.com/>`_ provides to this project a user with a
      higher 'Docker Hub Rate Limiting', this helps us to effectively build and
      test the different deployment use cases that are supported. This means that
      all container images can be pulled and processed in a streamlined manner.
