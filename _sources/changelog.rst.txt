    kubeinit_spec variable that is passed on the command line.
    The syntax for that value is:
      <distro>-<driver>-<controllers>-<computes>-<hypervisors>
  - Remove instructions for adding hypervisor host entries to the
    /etc/hosts file of machine where the ansible playbook is run.
    It is sufficient to just add aliases for any hypervisor hosts
    in the inventory to ~/.ssh/config entries.

    temporarily as we work on the new support for multiple deployed
    clusters on the same hypervisor hosts.
  - Simplify inventory network configuration to generate any needed
    network addresses from the cluster network dynamically.  Only
    the CIDR for the cluster network is required, which still has
    the same 10.0.0.0/24 default.
  - Change EKS to lookup current stable kubernetes release from the
    distribution website.
  - Update OKD release to 4.8 and FCOS/RHCOS releases from 33/4.7 to
    34/4.8 respectively.
- Move tasks from post-deployment to deploy-cluster. [Glenn Marcy]
- Replace with_items with loop and other updates. [Glenn Marcy]

---------------------------------



Chore
~~~~~
- Update OKD to latest 4.7. [Carlos Camacho]

  This commit updates the OKD version
  to the current latest.
- Use --no-cache-dir flag to pip in dockerfiles, to save space. [Pratik
  Raj]

  Using "--no-cache-dir" flag in pip install ,make sure dowloaded packages
  by pip don't cached on system . This is a best practise which make sure
  to fetch ftom repo instead of using local cached one . Further , in case
  of Docker Containers , by restricing caching , we can reduce image size.
  In term of stats , it depends upon the number of python packages
  multiplied by their respective size . e.g for heavy packages with a lot
  of dependencies it reduce a lot by don't caching pip packages.

  Further , more detail information can be found at

  This commit adds a new kubeinit_services role which will eventually be used
  to replace the current services virtual machine with podman services pods.
  Other changes include:
  - removal of all ansible tags left over from early prototyping
  - removal of all external interface code, which has been replaced by a new
    create-external-ingress script
  - consolidation of all podman login checks into a new prepare_podman step
  - other smaller miscellaneous changes

  This commit add more consolidation of facts into the prepare role
  so that the other roles can depend on that information being available
  to them later.

  just after the cluster is deployed. Let's give
  some time to the cluster to converge prior the test.

  together to provide more consistency in how facts are defined
  and made available for the roles that depend on those facts.
- Change all distros to share the same playbook. [Glenn Marcy]

  This commit replaces all current distro specific playbooks
  with symbolic links to a new common playbook.  Further
  refactoring is expected as we pivot to a common flow that
  they all would share, with minor changes as needed per
  distro, rather than the current case where each distro
  has it's only copy of the entire deployment which is for
  the most part the same for all distros.  Also fixed a
  broken symlink for the eks host group vars.
- Reorganize and cleanup service nodes. [Glenn Marcy]

  This commit makes some initial changes in preparation for future
  changes to how services are handled.  Now that services are all in

Performance
~~~~~~~~~~~
- Optimize dockerfile. [Raghavendra Talur]

  By moving the the COPY directive to a lower position, we can save
  rebuilds of the container when we are actively working on the code.

  As the packages are installed before the copy directive, the base
  container needs to be built only once.

Refactor
~~~~~~~~
- Remove unused, rename consistency. [Glenn Marcy]
- Use cluster name in all named cluster resources. [Glenn Marcy]

  This commit adds updates to the overall naming scene for cluster nodes so
  that we could support two clusters, either of the same or different distros,
  on the same hypervisor(s) without them conflicting with one another.  This
  is still a work in progress and other changes will be needed before that
  goal can be achieved.  The main change at this time is to remove the cluster
  distro prefix from inventories so that we can generate guest names with the
  cluster name as a prefix.

  Other changes include:
  - Added a section to the inventory describing the behavior of the bastion_host
    and delivered initial support for creating a bastion external to the cluster.
  - Replaced [bootstrap_node] with [extra_nodes] to generalize the idea of distro
    specific nodes, and added juju-controller to the CDK distro as an extra node.
  - Changed playbook sequence to separate out the network creation and cloud image
    download tasks and folded the distro specific service configuration into the
    prepare_cluster task.
  - All services now build local container images for their service configuration.
  - Cluster services now share configuration in services data volume mounted on
    /var/kubeinit in each container.
  - Updated distros to consolidate tasks into single prepare and deploy cluster flow.
  - Updated CDK distro to latest in charmstore, download standalone command from
    launchpad eliminating dependency on snap in the provision container, moved the
    juju-controller into an extra guest node that only performs that function.
  - Removed validation that cluster nodes need to match a specic pattern, more work
    in CI needed so that cluster node names can be arbitrary.
  - Changed veth0 names for guest vms to use ip4_hex representation.
  - Streamlined the flow through the kubeinit_services role tasks.
- Move cleanup tasks before run validations. [Glenn Marcy]

  This commit moves the cleanup tasks to a new spot after preparing
  the environment and before running validations.  Those cleanup tasks
  have also been optimized to run in parallel when the cluster is being
  deployed to multiple hypervisors.  OVN cleanup has also been adjusted
  to be more of a surgical operation, touching as little as necessary,
  rather than the scorched earth approach used previously.

  Other changes include adding kubeinit_cluster_fqdn as a shorter
  substitute for the cluster_name.cluster_domain, replacing append to
  authorized_keys shell commands with the authorized_key ansible task,
  streamlining the cloud image downloads and applying package updates
  to those images once for each copy rather than for each guest vm
  created from those images, collecting more information during initial
  fact gathering rather than spreading it out across many different roles,
  and many other minor improvements.
- Move post-deployment tasks to a new play task after deployment. [Glenn
  Marcy]

  This commit creates a new task-post-deployment task to the end of the
  cluster install play.  Other changes include updating the EKS kubernetes
  version to 1.21.4 and removing nfs from the pre-deployment services since
  it done in the post-deployment phase.
- Rename or remove post deployment task files. [Glenn Marcy]
