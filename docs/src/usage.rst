=====
Usage
=====

There are two ways of launching KubeInit, directly using the
ansible-playbook command from the project's source code,
or by running it inside a container.

Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~

* A fresh deployed server with enough RAM and disk space (120GB in RAM and 300GB in disk) and CentOS 8 (it should work also in Fedora/Debian/Ubuntu hosts).
* We assume that the hypervisor node is called nyctea (defined in the inventory).
* Have root passwordless access with certificates.
* Adjust the inventory file to suit your needs i.e. `the worker nodes <https://github.com/Kubeinit/kubeinit/blob/master/kubeinit/hosts/okd/inventory#L66>`_ you will need in your cluster.

Installing dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

KubeInit calls additional Ansible collections that needs to be installed.
If there are dependencies issues when executing the collection, install
them by executing:

.. code-block:: console

    git clone https://github.com/Kubeinit/kubeinit.git
    cd kubeinit
    ansible-galaxy collection install --force -r kubeinit/requirements.yml

An example of a possible dependency issue is the following:

.. code-block:: console

    TASK [Configure the cluster service node] ***************************************************************************************************************
    ERROR! couldn't resolve module/action 'community.general.docker_login'. This often indicates a misspelling, missing collection, or incorrect module path.

By default the KubeInit's container image installs these requirements, this should only affect
those executing directly the collection from the source code.

Directly executing the deployment playbook
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following example command will deploy a multi-master OKD 4.5 cluster with 1 worker node
in a single command and in approximately 30 minutes.

.. code-block:: console

    git clone https://github.com/Kubeinit/kubeinit.git
    cd kubeinit
    ansible-playbook \
        --user root \
        -v -i ./hosts/okd/inventory \
        --become \
        --become-user root \
        ./playbooks/okd.yml

After provisioning any of the scenarios, you should have your environment ready to go.
To connect to the nodes from the hypervisor use the IP addresses from the inventory files.

Running the deployment command from a container
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The whole process is explained in the `HowTo's <https://www.anstack.com/blog/2020/09/11/Deploying-KubeInit-from-a-container.html>`_.
The following commands build a container image with the project inside of it, and then
launches the container executing the ansible-playbook command with all the
standard ansible-playbook parameters.

Running from the GIT repository
-------------------------------

.. code-block:: console

    git clone https://github.com/Kubeinit/kubeinit.git
    cd kubeinit
    podman build -t kubeinit/kubeinit .

    podman run --rm -it \
        -v ~/.ssh/id_rsa:/root/.ssh/id_rsa:z \
        -v /etc/hosts:/etc/hosts \
        kubeinit/kubeinit \
            --user root \
            -v -i ./hosts/okd/inventory \
            --become \
            --become-user root \
            ./playbooks/okd.yml

Running from a release
----------------------

.. code-block:: console

    # Get the latest release tag
    TAG=$(curl --silent "https://api.github.com/repos/kubeinit/kubeinit/releases/latest" | jq -r .tag_name)
    podman run --rm -it \
        -v ~/.ssh/id_rsa:/root/.ssh/id_rsa:z \
        -v /etc/hosts:/etc/hosts \
        quay.io/kubeinit/kubeinit:$TAG \
            --user root \
            -v -i ./hosts/okd/inventory \
            --become \
            --become-user root \
            ./playbooks/okd.yml
